Oval
====
Oval (option valuation) is a my venture into option pricing. Options 
are everywhere. It exists not only in financial markets, but also
in our lives as well. Broadly speaking, options valuation is a way
to evaluate payoffs contingent on underlying phenomenon. For 
example, in life insurance, the policyholder is buying a put
option from life insurer on human capital contingent on life length. 
If he dies youngs, the life insurance policy is ITM (in the money). 
So now how do we value such option? Using risk neutral pricing, 
we can value the option as discounted expected payoffs 
under risk neutral measure. So This package will be my thinking in
code trying to understand the world from an option trader perspective.
